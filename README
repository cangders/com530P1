Subject:	Project 1 and Course Progress Self-critique Memo

-------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this memo is to provide you with a self-critique of my
Project 1 and course progress.

Project 1

Overall, I believe I did a decent job on the source code of my resume 
and portfolio. I tried to keep the formatting simple using unordered 
lists for almost the entire resume page. I added a little complexity 
to the page by floating the navigation menu to the right and using 
anchors to allow users to drop to a later part of the page.

Writing the CSS was the hardest part of this assignment. Initially, 
I wrote the CSS to match the resume page. When I wrote the portfolio 
page, I found myself adding to the CSS page instead of attempt to 
reuse the id and class from the resume.

If I could do the project over again, I would first sketch a layout 
design of my pages using some uniform ids and classes. The first 
draft of my resume page used a lot of <p> and <br /> when using 
unordered lists was more appropriate. I ended up drafting my resume 
page and then almost revising the entire source code to use unordered 
lists. I wrote the code as I designed the page resulting in a lot of 
guess-and-check work.

Class Progress

As I have mentioned before in class, I have taken a course on web 
design at DePaul, so I am familiar with basic XHTML and CSS. I have 
used git in a previous class as well so the tutorials on git have been 
a nice review for me. The biggest challenge for me will be to move 
away from my previous experiences of blindly copying-and-pasting 
source codes and scripts to consciously constructing source code from  
memory or reference materials.
