		<p class="caption">This newsletter was created collaboratively using Adobe InDesign for a group project
		in Document Design at Illinois Institute of Technology. Our group used Robin Williams' four basic design principles (proximity,
		alignment, repeitition, and contrast) to guide our design choices. Color was used significantly
		to group similar information.</p>

		<p class="caption">I wrote this proposal to improve the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool for a class on Chicago 
		Public Spaces at DePaul University. I took an existing proposal for renovation and added additional arguments 
		for moving forward with the improvements. Most of the images of the lily pool are my own. I presented this paper
		at the First Year Writing Showcase and won first prize.
